""" Market reference data

Reference data is a catch all term used in the finance industry to describe
counterparty and security identifiers.

As opposed to market data, the reference data is used to
complete financial transactions and settle those transactions.

At its most basic level,
reference data for a simple sale of a stock in exchange for cash
on a highly liquid stock exchange
that involves a standard label for the underlying security (e.g., its ISIN),
the identity of the seller, the buyer, the broker-dealer(s), the price, etc.
